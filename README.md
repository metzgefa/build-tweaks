# Build Tweaks
The original Minecraft mod, made for Project MineBuild!

# What does this mod?
This mod was originally made for adding 4 versions of a Machine Frame Block (As it was present in the 1.7 version of Minecraft in Thermal Expansion). These items where just made to add more complexity to the crafting recipes in the Minecraft Modpack Project MineBuild. Further in the development of the modpack, I realized, that their is no mod, that can change recipes in Thermal Expansion. So I added that to the mod. At the moment, the mod only changed some recipes, and canÂ´t be configured in any way. This feature will be added in one of the following versions, but probably only in 1.12 (sorry for that).
